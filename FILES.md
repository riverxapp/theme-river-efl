# FILES.md — Structural & Architectural Index (Next.js App Router Starter)

AI-facing index of the repository as it exists today. Drizzle ORM (PostgreSQL) is wired with a working credentials auth flow at `/auth` (server actions + cookie session) plus tokenized email verification/password reset flows. If something is unclear: **STOP AND ASK**.

---

## 1. High-Level Overview
- Purpose: SaaS boilerplate with App Router, Drizzle + Postgres schema, multi-tenant teams, and modular section-based landing architecture.
- Style: file-system routing, server-preferred components, small isolated client islands.
- Tech: Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind-ready PostCSS, ESLint 9, Zod for validation, SendGrid for email.
- Present: Drizzle schema + migrations for `users`, `teams`, `team_members`, `team_invitations`, `feature_items`, `auth_tokens`; `/auth` route with sign-in/sign-up server actions; email verification flow (token-based via SendGrid); password reset/forgot-password flow; shared dashboard layout with overview, settings (profile/email/password), team management, and a DB-backed feature CRUD reference page; invitation acceptance flow; reusable UI primitives; centralized theme system.
- Not present: middleware guards, queues, tests.

  - `components/dashboard/sidebar-nav.tsx`
  - `components/dashboard/user-menu.tsx`
  - `components/dashboard/mobile-nav.tsx`
  - `components/dashboard/dashboard-content.tsx`
- Dashboard route UIs:

  - `app/dashboard/settings/client.tsx`
  - `app/dashboard/team/client.tsx`
  - `app/dashboard/feature/client.tsx` (reference scaffold)
- Auth route UIs:

  - `app/auth/forgot-password/client.tsx`
  - `app/auth/reset-password/[token]/client.tsx`
- Invite route UI:
  - `app/invite/[token]/client.tsx`
- Shared reusable primitives and controls: `components/ui/*`.
- Theme toggle import contract: prefer `ThemeToggle` from `components/theme/theme-toggle.tsx`.

## 4. Routes (Controllers)
- `/` → `app/page.tsx`
  - Purpose: section-based landing page composed from `components/home/Layout*Section.tsx` modules.
  - Section IDs currently include: `layout-hero`, `layout-sponsors`, `layout-benefits`, `layout-features`, `layout-services`, `layout-testimonials`, `layout-team`, `layout-pricing`, `layout-contact`, `layout-faq`, `layout-footer`.
  - Visibility controls: `ONLY_SECTIONS` (whitelist) and `HIDE_SECTIONS` (blacklist).
  - Layout: responsive, centered content up to ~1600px; client interactivity kept in small islands.
  - To add a custom section: create `components/home/<NewLayoutSection>.tsx` and register it in the `sections` array in `app/page.tsx` with a stable ID.
  - DTOs/validation/guards: none; render-focused route.
- `/blank` → `app/blank/page.tsx`
  - Purpose: minimal landing starter with shared navbar/footer.
  - Use case: rapid creation of new marketing/landing variants without changing default `/`.
  - DTOs/validation/guards: none; render-focused route.
- `/auth` → `app/auth/page.tsx` + `app/auth/client.tsx`
  - Purpose: credentials entry (one visible form at a time, toggled sign-in/sign-up).
  - Backend wiring: form `action` targets server actions in `app/auth/actions.ts`.
  - Data contract:
    - Sign up inserts into `users` with `password_hash` from bcrypt, auto-creates a personal team, and adds user as owner.
    - Sign in verifies `email` + bcrypt password compare.
    - Redirect safety: `redirectTo` only accepts internal paths that start with `/`.
  - Mode deep links: `/auth#signin`, `/auth#signup`.
  - Signup sends a verification email; verification token is consumed at `/auth/verify-email/[token]`.
- `/auth/forgot-password` → `app/auth/forgot-password/page.tsx` + `client.tsx`
  - Purpose: collect email for password reset request.
  - Backend wiring: `app/auth/forgot-password/actions.ts` generates a `password_reset` token (1-hour TTL) and sends a reset email via SendGrid. Returns a generic success message regardless of whether the email exists (prevents user enumeration).
- `/auth/reset-password/[token]` → `app/auth/reset-password/[token]/page.tsx` + `client.tsx`
  - Purpose: accept a new password after clicking the reset link.
  - Backend wiring: `app/auth/reset-password/[token]/actions.ts` consumes the token (single-use) and updates the password hash.
  - Server component validates token before rendering the form.
- `/auth/verify-email/[token]` → `app/auth/verify-email/[token]/page.tsx`
  - Purpose: consume email verification token and set `users.emailVerified`.
  - Server-only (no client component); redirects to `/dashboard` when a session exists, otherwise redirects to `/auth#signin` with flash status/message.
- `/dashboard` → `app/dashboard/layout.tsx` + `app/dashboard/page.tsx` + `app/dashboard/client.tsx`
  - Layout: shared sidebar (Overview, Team, Settings) + header with sign-out. Auth guard reads session from `lib/auth/session.ts` and redirects unauthenticated users to `/auth#signin`.
  - Purpose: dashboard overview with demo metric cards, getting started checklist, charts, recent activity feed, and a mock Dialog-based CRUD example (local state only).
  - Backend wiring: sign-out form uses server action from `app/dashboard/actions.tsx` (`clearAuthSession()` + redirect).
- `/dashboard/settings` → `app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` + `app/dashboard/settings/client.tsx`
  - Purpose: account settings for profile (first/last name), email, password, and account deletion.
  - Backend wiring: forms target server actions in `app/dashboard/settings/actions.tsx`.
  - Data contract:
    - Update profile writes `firstName`/`lastName` to `users` table.
    - Update email verifies current password, checks uniqueness, updates `users.email`, and refreshes auth session.
    - Update password verifies current password and writes new bcrypt hash to `users.password_hash`.
    - Delete account verifies current password, deletes user row, and clears session.
- `/dashboard/team` → `app/dashboard/team/page.tsx` + `app/dashboard/team/client.tsx`
  - Purpose: team management — view members, manage roles, invite new members, view/revoke pending invitations.
  - Backend wiring: forms target server actions in `app/dashboard/team/actions.tsx`.
  - Data contract:
    - Invite creates `team_invitations` row with unique token, sends SendGrid email.
    - Revoke sets invitation status to `expired`.
    - Remove deletes `team_members` row (owner/admin only, cannot remove owner).
    - Role update changes `team_members.role` (owner only).
    - Team name updates `teams.name`.
- `/dashboard/feature` → `app/dashboard/feature/page.tsx` + `app/dashboard/feature/client.tsx`
  - Purpose: canonical CRUD scaffold for future dashboard features.
  - Backend wiring: forms target server actions in `app/dashboard/feature/actions.tsx`.
  - Data contract:
    - Create inserts `feature_items` row scoped by `team_id`.
    - Update mutates row by `id` and `team_id` guard.
    - Delete removes row by `id` and `team_id` guard.
  - Permission model: owner/admin can mutate; members can read.
- `/invite/[token]` → `app/invite/[token]/page.tsx` + `app/invite/[token]/client.tsx`
  - Purpose: invitation acceptance — validates token, checks expiry, adds logged-in user to team.
  - If user is not logged in, redirects to `/auth?redirect=/invite/:token#signin`.
  - Backend wiring: `app/invite/[token]/actions.ts` handles acceptance.

## 5. Services & Providers
- `ThemeProvider`: centralized in `components/theme/theme-provider.tsx`, mounted at root layout.
- SendGrid email: `lib/email/sendgrid.ts` (server-side, sends transactional email for invitations, verification, and password reset).
- Auth session: `lib/auth/session.ts` (cookie-based, stores JSON `{ userId, email }` payload with iframe-compatible attributes: `sameSite: "none"`, `secure: true`, `httpOnly: true`, `path: "/"`).
- No background service layer or worker runtime in-app.

## 6. Data Layer
- ORM/DB: Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL.
- Schema: `lib/db/schema.ts` — tables: `users`, `teams`, `team_members`, `team_invitations`, `feature_items`, `auth_tokens`.
- Client: `lib/db/client.ts`.
- Migrations: `drizzle/*.sql` + `drizzle/meta/_journal.json` (`0000` base tables + `0001` feature CRUD table + `0002` auth tokens table).
- Auth persistence: `users` table is the source of truth for credentials flow.
- Auth token persistence: `auth_tokens` stores one active token per user/type (`email_verification`, `password_reset`) and tokens are consumed once.
- Team model: multi-tenant. Each user belongs to a team via `team_members` (roles: `owner`, `admin`, `member`). A personal team is auto-created on signup. Invitations are tracked in `team_invitations` with unique tokens and expiry.
- Rule: keep migrations and journal in sync; `scripts/db-init.js` validates journal integrity before migrate.

## 7. DTOs, Schemas & Validation
- Server actions use Zod for input validation (schemas co-located in the action files).
- UI form primitives exist in `components/ui/form.tsx` and related controls.
- When adding APIs/forms, keep validators with the feature or under `lib/validation/` and document contracts.

## 8. Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Middleware guards, tracing, and centralized logging are not implemented.
- Credentials auth form + DB actions are implemented; cookie-based session (`lib/auth/session.ts`) stores `{ userId, email }`. Dashboard layout enforces auth guard.
- Current custom auth type is stateful cookie session (credentials + DB user lookup + `httpOnly` cookie managed in `lib/auth/session.ts`).
- If custom auth is expanded, standardize on DB-backed session IDs (opaque/signed token) instead of raw identity values in cookie payloads.
- Iframe embedding cookie policy is defined in `README.md` Section 14 and mirrored in `RULES.md` Auth & Security rules.
- Error forwarding exists via `scripts/error-reporter.ts` + `components/ErrorReporter.tsx`.
- Theme switching is cross-cutting and centralized in `components/theme/*`.
- Email delivery via SendGrid is wired for team invitations, email verification, and password reset; gracefully degrades if `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is not set.

## 9. Configuration & Environment
- `env.example` currently defines: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, optional `OPENAI_MODEL`, `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_SSL`, `BASE_URL`, `SENDGRID_API_KEY`, `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL`, and optional `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.
- Secrets: keep in `.env.local` (gitignored); never commit secrets.
- Config files in repo: `next.config.ts`, `postcss.config.mjs`, `eslint.config.mjs`, `tsconfig.json`, `drizzle.config.ts`, `railpack.json` (inactive while Dockerfile deploys are active), `railway.json`.
- Runtime/deployment contract: Docker (`Dockerfile`) by Railway for development workflow and Vercel for production. `railpack.json` is retained but inactive while Dockerfile deploys are active.

## 10. Async & Background Processing
- Queues/workers/schedulers: none.
- Operational scripts in `scripts/`:
  - `dev-supervisor.js`: supervised dev runtime (Next + git poll integration).
  - `git-poll.js`: optional origin polling for supervised environments.
  - `db-init.js`: migration bootstrap with Drizzle journal guard.

## 11. Testing Structure
- No tests currently.
- Suggested layout when added: unit (`__tests__/` or co-located), e2e (`e2e/` via Playwright), shared fixtures in `tests/utils/`.

## 13. Safe Modification Guidance
- New public pages: add under `app/` with route folders (for example `app/about/page.tsx`).
- New dashboard features: add under `app/dashboard/<feature>/` with co-located actions. The shared layout (`app/dashboard/layout.tsx`) handles sidebar and auth guard automatically.
- Landing sections: add under `components/home/` and register in `app/page.tsx` using stable section IDs.
- Data/API: place server code in `lib/` or `app/api/.../route.ts`; validate inputs at the edge; keep server-only dependencies out of client components.
- Keep theme logic centralized in `components/theme/*`.
- Avoid expanding global CSS unnecessarily; prefer scoped/component styles.
- Keep changes minimal; update `README.md` and `RULES.md` if scope (auth, DB, payments, deployment architecture) changes.
